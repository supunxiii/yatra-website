            For adventurers and thrill seekers, there are multiple opportunities for hiking in Sri Lanka. Most hikes commence from the Hill country region of Sri Lanka, which includes towns like Ella and Nuwara Eliya that serve as a base to set off on some breathtaking trails. Other interesting hikes are around the cultural triangle of the country. Whether you're looking for easy trails or adventurous hikes, or simply exploring the serene cascades across the region, you can never run out of exciting things to do in Sri Lanka. <br/><br/>
            You ought to take a <b>45 minute</b> drive from Nuwara Eliya to the starting point of the trek. The scenic route along the narrow mountain paths eventually leads to the Horton Plains National Park - one of the few National Parks that can be explored on foot. The highlight of this hike is going up to the World's End point where the plateau takes a fall of 800m with a surreal view of the valley. A dreamy cascade along the horton plains, bound to take your breath away.
          </p>
          <p>
            The quaint town of Ella, perched in the Sri Lankan hill country region has a lot more to offer than lush green tea plantations. For all those thrill seekers, Ella is the base for two of the most famous treks on the island. If you're looking to go hiking in Sri Lanka, these are two unmissable trails. An easy hike to the highest cliff in the village, both treks are the perfect points to experience a picturesque panoramic view of the entire region. We highly recommend that you commence the hike early morning to witness a splendid sunrise from the summit. According to <a class="in-text"

          <p>
            After coming off the slopes of Adam's Peak, the clear waters of the Kelani Riverwind their way through the Hill Country of inland Sri Lanka before emptying into the Indian Ocean. The put in for rafting is just upstream from Kithulgala, a small town in the tea country. After a safety briefing and a few pointers on rafting technique, you can jump right into the action. Seven high quality, class II and III rapids and temperate waters make the Kelani a premier introduction to the sport of whitewater or an exciting choice for experienced rafters. The river hosts rapids between grades 2 and 3, with the rafting stretch approximately 6.5 kilometers in length, and taking between <b>45 minutes to 1.5 hours</b> to complete, depending on water levels. With the Kelani's special “Killer Fall” and “Butter Crunch” rapids, rafters are guaranteed a challenge, but are also offered a chance to relax, with small calm stretches allowing a refreshing swim in the river to unwind. Ideal times are from May to December, although there are no “bad” times. The river is dam controlled. Therefore, water levels can be low in April, but can also be quite high during the monsoon season. Along the way, you'll have the option to hike down one of the river's side canyons where we'll jump into plunge pools, wade across “potholes,” and shoot down a few slides. The Lower Kelani is the second leg of combined rafting and canyoning trip and is suitable for children of all ages. We have strict minimum age limits, and we do not take children under eleven rafting on the upper section with its Class III rapids. According to <a class="in-text"

            When visiting the wonder of Asia that is Sri Lanka, your itinerary wouldn't be complete without a trip to one of the amazing Safaris on offer in the country. When you think of a safari, we typically think of Africa, but don't underestimate the greatness of a Sri Lanka Safari. There are 22 Sri Lanka national parks. But with so much choice, it's hard to know where to start searching for the perfect Sri lanka safari tours. Sri Lanka wildlife consists of amazing elephants, bears, leopards and so much more. Yala national park is probably the most popular and well known safari in all of Sri Lanka. It's the second largest national park in Sri Lanka and it's a wonderful safari experience for all, especially families. The only problem with Yala is that because it is so popular, you're going to be in a park that is filled with jeeps. You may even see more jeeps than animals, and because of the high number of visitors, the chances of seeing leopards is slim due to the noise etc. But, you have a very high chance of seeing lots of elephants, so if you love elephants and don't mind the crowds, then it's a great choice!

          <p>
            Udawalawe National Park is smaller, a third of the size of Yala, covering 308 square km (119 square miles). Nonetheless, given its smaller size, Udawalawe has a greater density of animal to size ratio, particularly with Sri Lankan elephants. Being a less popular safari destination than Udawalawe, it is also quieter, which makes it a more enjoyable safari experience. According to <a class="in-text"

            The South Asian island nation of Sri Lanka offers visitors a dizzying array of things to see and do. You can experience tourist attractions like the towering new Lotus Tower in the capital city of Colombo, or see elephants living their best life in the forest at Minneriya National Park. There are also outdoor attractions like doing a leopard-watching safari at Yala National Park or hiking a pilgrimage trail at night to see the sunrise on the summit of Adam's Peak.

          <p>
            Throughout Sri Lanka there are natural caves that have been enlarged and excavated to be turned into cave temples. Like other temples, they honor Buddha and other deities (and a few kings) with large statues and relics. The Dambulla cave temple is a UNESCO World Heritage site. It's the largest cave temple complex in the country and the best preserved. Of particular interest are the beautiful, now-preserved and conserved colorful wall murals that decorate the cave walls. Aside from the cave temples, there is a large, golden Buddha statue at the base of the mountain, giving the site its other name, the Golden Temple of Dambulla. Dambulla is about two hours outside Colombo. Find more about <a class="in-text"

            This ancient rock fortress of Sigiriya was once the mountaintop palace of the island's king. Believed to have been constructed during the 4th and 5th centuries CE, the palace ruins are at the top of a 660-foot (220-meter) rock formation. The sides of the mountain had giant frescoes painted on them, and halfway up the mountain there's a giant gateway carved in the shape of a lion. The structure's name means lion rock in ancient Sanskrit. The palace above and the city complex below are one of the world's most important examples of urban planning in the first millennium. The ruins are near the town of Dambulla in the Central Province of the country. Find more about <a class="in-text"

            Sri Lanka is becoming one of the most successful places to see both blue and sperm whales, which can be found off the island's southern coast. The best time to go is between <b>December and April</b> when the sea is calm and these spectacular mammals traverse the Sri Lankan waters. During this period the chance of spotting whales and large pods of dolphins is very likely, often only a few miles off the coast. Group departures generally leave Mirissa Harbour, near Dondra Point at around <b>7 am </b>returning later in the <b>morning or early afternoon</b> depending on the sightings. Life jackets are provided on board the boat. Mirissa Harbour is only about <b>40 minutes</b> from the city of Galle depending on traffic. According to <a class="in-text"

            Bathed in warm Indian Ocean currents, and with 1600 km of palm-fringed coastline, Sri Lanka is an amazing dive destination. The waters of Sri Lanka are home to an incredible range of marine creatures from massive blue whales all the way through to tiny nudibranch. Sri Lanka has an abundance of great sites to discover including wrecks scattered off the coast - local divers are still discovering new ones. Many of the wrecks are covered in marine life, soft corals, macro critters and large aggregations of schooling fish. Above the surface, Sri Lanka also boasts wildlife reserves, which protect native species such as leopards, porcupines and anteaters. It is also famous for unique foods and teas, which should be sampled as part of any dive trip.
