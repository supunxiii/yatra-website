          <p>
            Marble beach, also known as Marble Bay is one of the beautiful beaches in Trincomalee. Because it's 17 kilometres outside of Trincomalee located, not many people know about this place. Run by the air force, there is a resort and restaurant at the north end of the cove of Marble beach. Spend your time at the south end of the beach in beautiful emerald water and enjoy the quiet area. Because the sunrise is at this side of Sri Lanka, you might want to start your day with that. But in that case, you have to be an early bird if you're seeking for a relaxing day at the beach, you can go to Marble beach anytime, but be aware that on weekdays it can get busy with school groups in the afternoon.

          <p>
            This mile-long beach on Pasikuda Bay is perfect for swimming and wading. The surf is gentle, protected by a reef, unlike many beaches in Sri Lanka with rough surf. The water is also shallow, allowing you to walk out into the ocean for hundreds of yards. The sand is bright white and soft, with fine grains, and the beach is lined with coconut trees. This area is just starting to be discovered for luxury resort development, so there is plenty of untouched beach to explore. The Kalkudah Bay is a 2 km long wide stretch of beach, located 32 km north of Batticaloa. Kalkudah & Passikudah are two very fine beaches in the East Coast of Sri Lanka. One of the best and unspoilt stretches of beaches in Sri Lanka is the East Coast which runs for more than 300 kilometres. Most of the beach areas are well protected from the monsoon by off shore reefs. Kalkudah which offers guests the combination of a sun and sand holiday is emerging as a popular tourist centre with many modern hotels and stylish villas coming up. The best time to visit the East coast is ideally from May to September, as it is dry during this period. The beach is adorned with coconut palms and is always a beautiful sight to admire.

          <p>
            Nilaveli Beach is a broad, sandy beach, lined with palm trees and dotted with fishermen's boats. Located on the northeast part of Sri Lanka, it's a 30-minute drive from the city of Trincomalee. This tiny island has calm beaches with gentle surf due to its own small reef. Although the beach at Nilaveli is large, it is popular with both locals and tourists. There are lifeguards on duty and many little restaurants along the beach, most specializing in seafood. The Trincomalee area is also good for sightseeing, as it's a center of Tamil culture. Tamil is the name of the language spoken in Sri Lanka and the ethnic group to which the majority of its residents belong. If the isolation of Nilaveli isn't enough, you can take a boat to <b> Pigeon Island National Park</b>, about a half-mile off the coast. This idyllic island is best known for its snorkeling and scuba diving, and there is a good diving school near the beach, as well as a tour operator that provides guided tours of the island.

          <img src="images/mirissa.jpg" alt="beach" /><figcaption>Mirissa is one of the most popular beach destinations in southern Sri Lanka, and for a good reason.</figcaption></figure>
          <p>
            Mirissa is the largest fishing port on the south coast and sits right on the southern tip of the island. Its beauty and relative proximity to Colombo (the capital city) mean it's not hard to access. It's about a two-hour drive from the capital's airport. The small beach town and its large beach are beautiful, backed by a dense grove of palm trees. The town is on a little hill that rises up behind the beach. 
            Mirissa Beach is arrow-shaped, with the arrow tip sticking out into the sea. This natural jetty also makes the surf calm and good for swimming. The beaches are bright white, with soft, fine sand, and the water is crystal clear. It's light green where the bottom is sandy and dark blue where there are rocks or reef. Mirissa is also a great place if you want to do some whale watching, best done in February and March.

          <p>
            Arugam Bay is dramatically beautiful, with bright white sand and deep blue water gradually becoming green the closer you get to the shore. With that beauty comes some of the best surf breaks in Sri Lanka, and the beach is known as an international surf destination. This reputation brings many visitors but also means the area has a good tourist infrastructure and is easy to access. The curving beach feels a bit like a Hawaiian beach - the area near the water slopes down, and there's a dry, sandy section, then rougher areas with shrubs and a tree line.

          <p>
            Another beach known for its strong surf and good surfing, Hikkaduwa is in the southwest, close to Galle and about 95 kilometers from Colombo. The beach is typical of those in Sri Lanka, backed with dense foliage and palm trees. The water here is bright aqua and the sand is fine and white. A national park lies behind the beach area. It's one of only three marine national parks in the country and has its own coral sanctuary. In addition to the coral, the park is known for its marine turtles and fish.

            <p>
              Located towards the south of Colombo, Mount Lavinia is an immediate Colombo city suburb and the Mount Lavinia beach is one of the better known locations to relax even during colonial times. It lies alongside a windswept headland jutting into the waters of the Indian Ocean. The sand is the softest while the waves are calm and clear. The Governor's House built in 1805 by Sir Thomas Maitland, now forms part of the famous Mount Lavinia Hotel.
